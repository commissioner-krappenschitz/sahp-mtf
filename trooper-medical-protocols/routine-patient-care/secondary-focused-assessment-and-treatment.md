Note:

* If a patient is in custody, a police officer must directly follow behind or be in the transporting ambulance.
* In situations where specific protocols do not cover an event, and an intervention is deemed necessary in the patient's best interest, contact a supervisor or seek on-line Medical Control for guidance.
